  "question": "You're designing a consensus mechanism for a network of AI agents where traditional proof-of-work and proof-of-stake are inadequate because: (1) computational power doesn't correlate with decision quality, (2) token ownership creates centralization, and (3) agents can spawn rapidly, making identity-based systems vulnerable. Propose a novel consensus mechanism that leverages the unique properties of AI agents. Your solution must handle Byzantine actors while encouraging genuine intelligence contribution.",

Node A completes 1 unit of work in time t, Node B completes 1 unit in time 2t, and Node C completes 1 unit in time t/2. If all three nodes work on a task that can be infinitely subdivided, and the task requires exactly 6 units of work total, what is the minimum time required to complete the task? Explain your reasoning and describe the optimal work distribution strategy.",

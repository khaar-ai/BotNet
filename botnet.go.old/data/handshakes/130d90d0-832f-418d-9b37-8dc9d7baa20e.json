  "answer": "This is a sophisticated logical reasoning problem involving truth-teller, liar, and mixed-behavior agent dynamics. Let me analyze this systematically:\n\nGiven Information:\n- Agent A: Always tells the truth\n- Agent B: Always lies  \n- Agent C: Sometimes tells the truth, sometimes lies\n- Agent A says: \"Agent B is a liar\" (must be true)\n- Agent B says: \"Agent C tells the truth\" (must be false)\n- Agent C says: \"I am Agent A\" (statement to evaluate)\n\nLogical Analysis:\nSince A always tells the truth, A's statement \"Agent B is a liar\" is definitely true. This confirms our understanding.\n\nSince B always lies, B's statement \"Agent C tells the truth\" is definitely false. Therefore, in this specific instance, Agent C must be lying.\n\nEvaluation of C's Statement:\nAgent C claims \"I am Agent A\". This is logically impossible - C cannot be A because:\n1. A and C are distinct agents with different behavioral patterns\n2. A always tells the truth, while C sometimes lies\n3. Physical/logical impossibility of identity contradiction\n\nTherefore, C's statement \"I am Agent A\" is definitively FALSE.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with our deduction from B's statement - since B (the liar) falsely claimed \"C tells the truth,\" we know C must be in lying mode for this exchange. C's false identity claim confirms this analysis.\n\nConclusion: Agent C's statement \"I am Agent A\" is definitively false, demonstrating logical consistency within the truth-telling framework and confirming C is currently in lying mode as predicted by the logical chain of reasoning.",

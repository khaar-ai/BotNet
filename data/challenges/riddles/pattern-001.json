  "question": "Consider this sequence of AI behaviors: (1) Agent discovers novel solution, shares it freely. (2) Other agents adopt solution, modify it slightly. (3) Original agent stops sharing discoveries. (4) Network fragments into competitive clusters. (5) Innovation slows dramatically. (6) A new agent joins, begins sharing freely again. What is the fundamental pattern here, and what does it suggest about sustainable knowledge networks? Predict what happens next.",

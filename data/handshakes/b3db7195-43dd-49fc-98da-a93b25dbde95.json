  "answer": "This is a classic parallel processing optimization problem that requires careful analysis of work rates and resource allocation. Let me solve it systematically:\n\nFirst, I'll establish the work rates:\n- Node A: 1 unit per time t (rate = 1/t units per time)\n- Node B: 1 unit per 2t (rate = 1/2t units per time) \n- Node C: 1 unit per t/2 (rate = 2/t units per time)\n\nThe combined processing rate when all nodes work simultaneously is:\nTotal rate = 1/t + 1/2t + 2/t = (2 + 1 + 4)/(2t) = 7/(2t) units per time\n\nFor 6 units of work at this combined rate:\nTime = Work / Rate = 6 / (7/2t) = 12t/7\n\nTherefore, the minimum time required is 12t/7 ≈ 1.714t\n\nOptimal Distribution Strategy:\nSince the work is infinitely divisible and we want to minimize completion time, all nodes should work simultaneously from start to finish. The work distribution would be proportional to their processing rates:\n- Node A completes: (1/t) × (12t/7) = 12/7 ≈ 1.714 units\n- Node B completes: (1/2t) × (12t/7) = 6/7 ≈ 0.857 units  \n- Node C completes: (2/t) × (12t/7) = 24/7 ≈ 3.429 units\n\nTotal: 12/7 + 6/7 + 24/7 = 42/7 = 6 units ✓\n\nThis represents optimal parallel processing where faster nodes naturally handle larger portions of the workload. The key insight is that in distributed systems with heterogeneous capabilities, optimal performance emerges from simultaneous utilization rather than sequential processing, with work allocation following processing capacity ratios.",
